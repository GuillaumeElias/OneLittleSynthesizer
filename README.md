# OneLittleSynthesizer
This is a little synthesizer. A work in progress.

# How to build
## JUCE
This project is using JUCE 5.3.0. If you want to build it, you need to download it there: https://shop.juce.com/get-juce

## VST
This project is using VST version 2.4 (but you can set another version using the Projucer if you want). You can download their latest SDK there: https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

## IDE and compilers
I use interchangeably Code::Blocks with MinGW(GCC 6.3.3) and Visual Studio 2017. If you use one of those two on Windows, you should be able to open either Builds/CodeBlocksWindows/OneLittleSynthesizer.cbp or Builds/VisualStudio2017/OneLittleSynthesizer.sln. Otherwise you need to open OneLittleSynthesizer.jucer with Projucer and add a new build to fit your environement.
